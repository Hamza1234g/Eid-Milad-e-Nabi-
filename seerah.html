  <section>
    <h2>Early Life</h2>
    <p>
      Prophet Muhammad ï·º was born in Makkah in the <strong>Year of the Elephant</strong> (around 570 CE). 
      This year is named after the famous event when a ruler named Abraha came with an army and elephants 
      to destroy the Kaaba. Allah protected the Kaaba by sending birds (<em>Ababil</em>) carrying stones, 
      which destroyed the army. This event is mentioned in the Qur'an in <em>Surah al-Fil</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his youth, he was known for his honesty and trustworthiness, and people called him 
      <em>Al-Amin</em> (the Trustworthy).
    </p>

    <h2>Prophethood</h2>
    <p>
      At age 40, he received the first revelation in the Cave of Hira. 
      He called people to Tawheed (Oneness of Allah).
    </p>

    <h2>Migration</h2>
    <p>
      Due to persecution, he and his companions migrated to Madinah, 
      marking the start of the Islamic calendar.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Sermon</h2>
    <p>
      In his farewell sermon, he emphasized equality, justice, and kindness. 
      Shortly after, he passed away in Madinah.
